  The leader ratings are assigned based on a combination of your involvement with MITOC and leadership experience
  in addition to your baseline technical skills of hiking in the Whites.
  </p>
  <p>The requirements are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Co-Leader: Participant in two MITOC hiking events. Must be different weekends.</li>
    <li>Leader: Co-lead two official MITOC hikes (on separate weekends). On one of the hikes, handle the majority of the planning and group management, and get a recommendation from the leader.</li>
  </ul>

    Please complete and submit the form below if you're interested in becoming a MITOC Winter School Leader.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rating system outlined here determines the categories within which leaders are allowed to conduct trips.
    Qualifications for a particular category are a combination of outdoor experience and leadership, particularly in winter conditions.

      <h4>Ratings by Location</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>A</strong>: less than one hour from intensive care (ski resorts, short hikes from the road, et cetera)</li>
        <li><strong>B</strong>: anything below treeline more than one hour from intensive care</li>
        <li><strong>C</strong>: above treeline</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Ratings by Activity</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>I</strong>: ice climbing</li>
        <li><strong>S</strong>: telemark/backcountry skiing</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Primary leaders (A, B, C, I, S)</h4>

      Each Winter School trip must have a minimum of two leaders,
      at least one of whom is rated as a 'primary' leader.
      WFA or higher is required for all B and C primary leaders.
      Please note that full C ratings have typically been denied to people who have not
      demonstrated ability to act as primary leader on at least one Winter School trip
      in above-treeline conditions (e.g. by "running the show" as a co-leader).

      <h4>Co-leaders (co-A, co-B, co-C, co-I, co-S)</h4>

      <p>Co-leaders require a primary leader to be present in the group in order to lead a trip.
      Co-ratings are given to those who show promise in an area but have not demonstrated the specific outdoor experience/leadership/group management necessary for a full rating.
      This allows them to gain experience under the supervision of an experienced leader.
      Co-leaders are encouraged to use the earlier weeks of Winter School to demonstrate the skill set necessary to be 'upgraded' to primary leader prior to the close of IAP.
      </p>

      <h4>How ratings work</h4>

      <p>
      All leaders are assigned a location rating along with any applicable activity ratings.
      Activity ratings are subordinate to location ratings: a {B, S} leader can only lead ski mountaineering trips below treeline.
      A leader rated {A, co-B, co-I} can act as primary leader on A-level trips, can co-lead B-level trips with a full B or C leader, and can co-lead ice climbing trips as long as they qualify as B level or below.
