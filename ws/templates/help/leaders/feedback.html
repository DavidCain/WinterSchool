  <h2>Feedback</h2>

  <div class="well" id="view_past_feedback">
    <h4>How do I view a participant's past feedback?</h4>
    <p>
      When <a href="{% url 'help-trip_admin' %}">administrating your trip</a>,
      a summary of each participant's past feedback will appear in the signup
      table. Each instance of leader comments will include the leader supplying
      the feedback as well as the relevant trip. This information is also
      available on any participant's summary page (which you can find linked to
      across the site, or via <a href="{% url 'participant_lookup' %}">participant lookup</a>).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="submit_feedback">
    <h4>How do I submit feedback?</h4>
    <p>
      After your trip has completed, you'll receive notifications to review
      your participants. Supply comments about your participants, specify any
      others that &quot;flaked&quot; on your trip, then hit &quot;submit.&quot;
      You're done!
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="signing_feedback">
    <h4>Do I need to sign feedback?</h4>
    <p>
      Nope! All actions performed on the site are automatically linked to your
      account. There's no need to sign feedback with your name, or indicate the
      trip it pertains to.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="what_counts_as_flaking">
    <h4>What counts as flaking?</h4>
    <p>
      It is up to each leader to discern the difference between what counts as
      flaking and what is a legitimate reason not to attend the trip. However,
      the following circumstances should generally prompt you to list the
      participant as a flake:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attending the pre-trip meeting, then later deciding not to attend</li>
      <li>Failing to show up on time for their ride</li>
      <li>Abandoning the trip due to coursework, other responsibilities</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="valid_no-show">
    <h4>What if a participant didn't go on my trip, but didn't &quot;flake&quot; either?</h4>
    <p>
      If you've determined that the participant's reason for not attending your
      trip should not count as flaking, navigate to your trip administration
      page and delete their signup. This will reflect that they did not attend
      your trip while not penalizing them.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="feedback_content">
    <h4>What should I put in feedback?</h4>
    <p>
      The feedback feature is designed to help other leaders gauge a
      participant's abilities and fitness for future trips. Accordingly, please
      specify anything that would be useful to future leaders. This may
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical fitness, general demeanor</li>
      <li>Level of preparedness</li>
      <li>Whether or not the participant showed up (please check the box)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By indicating that a participant did not show up for your trip, you are
      helping more reliable participants to get placed on trips over
      &quot;flaky&quot; participants.
    </p>
