<p>Dear Mt. Monroe Trip Participants,</p>
<p>Please READ the following advice on your trip. ALL of you should read the following in its entirety.</p>
<p>The following is instructions and advice on your Winter School trip. Please read it IN ITS ENTIRETY.
Please complete the section at the bottom and return the information to me and Bob Beaver ASAP, along with any questions.</p>

<h3>Leaders</h3>
<p>Tim the Beaver (617.555.0987) and Fruity Loopy (617.555.1234)</p>

<h3>The Route</h3>
<p>We'll hike Mt. Monroe from Marshfield Station at the base of the Cog Railway in Bretton Woods, NH.
From the station, we'll take the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail up past the AMC Lakes of the Clouds Hut and on to the summit of Mt. Monroe.
This hike will be 7.2 miles round-trip and will involve about 3000' of elevation gain.</p>

<p>FULL ABOVE-TREELINE GEAR INCLUDING BODY COVER, CRAMPONS, AND AN ICE AXE IS REQUIRED.</p>

<h3>Contingency Plans</h3>
<p>As always, a winter ascent in the White Mountains is a gamble. Trips frequently get to treeline
and have to turn around due to high winds. Make sure that you are comfortable using an Ice-axe and crampons.
Also, make sure that you have tested out the gear well in advance of the actual trip. A proper fit on crampons
and snowshoes is absolutely vital for your safety and the safety of others. If in doubt, consult your trip leader
well in advance of the trip, or as a last resort, at the trail-head BEFORE starting the hike.</p>

<h3>Educational Objectives</h3>
<p>This trip will offer an opportunity for participants to test their winter hiking, navigation, crampon/snowshoe,
and above-treeline skills.</p>

<h3>Tentative Schedule</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Saturday, 8:15am: Meet at the Cog Railway base station (It is most efficient to come up I-93 and then head toward Crawford Notch, look for Cog Railway signs)</li>
  <li>Saturday, 8:30am: Start up the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail</li>
  <li>Saturday, 4:30pm: Return to cars via Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gear</h3>
<p>By now, you should have a pretty good feel for what gear is expected of you on a trip like this,
but here's a checklist for your convenience. Not all of this gear is explicitly required, but check
with me if you're afraid you might be lacking in a particular area.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Boot/crampon system that you have used previously with success. CRAMPONS REQUIRED.</li>

  The Winter School Trip fee is $5 per day, to cover White Mountain Guide
  Permits and safety gear. Please pay this at office hours before the trip, or

  help cover gas and maintenance costs. Bring some extra cash for breakfast,
  snacks, and other incidentals.
