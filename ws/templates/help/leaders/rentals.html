    <h4>Renting a Car Through MIT</h4>
    <p>
      MIT students, faculty, and staff who wish to rent a vehicle for a MITOC
      trip are eligible to use MIT's corporate agreements with
      <a href="https://www.budget.com/en/corporate/layout1/T2/T240202">Budget</a>
      and
      <a href="https://www.avis.com/en/corporate/A122600">Avis</a>
      for business travelers. In addition to offering discounted rates and
      waiving the requirement for renters to be at least 25 years of age, the
      rental agency provides insurance coverage against both liability and
      physical damage. The trip must have been approved by the club and
      registered with the MIT Student Activities Office; contact
      <a href="mailto:mitoc-bursar@mit.edu">mitoc-bursar@mit.edu</a>
      to obtain confirmation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Visit the link for either rental agency and click "Make a Business Rental".
      Make sure to decline liability and collision/physical damage coverage when
      reserving or picking up the vehicle. More details are available from the
      <a href="https://insurance.mit.edu/services/insurance-coverage-claims/automobile/rentals">MIT Office of Insurance.</a>

    <h4>Car Sharing Services</h4>
    <p>
      If using a car sharing service such as
      <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/universities/massachusetts-institute-of-technology">Zipcar</a>,
      be aware that the mileage included in the hourly/daily rate is often less
      than the round-trip distance to and from out-of-state trailheads
      frequently visited by MITOC, which may result in additional charges.
