  <h2>Renting a Car for MITOC Trips</h2>
  <div class="well" id="through_mit">
    <h4>Renting a car through MIT</h4>
    <p>
      <em>Sorry, but independent trips with MITOC gear donâ€™t qualify for car rental discounts.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      For official MITOC trips, MIT students, faculty, and staff are eligible
      to use MIT's corporate agreements with
      <a href="https://vpf.mit.edu/avis-car-rental">Avis</a>
      and
      <a href="https://vpf.mit.edu/budget-car-rental">Budget</a>
      for business travelers. Renting this way:
      <ol>
        <li>offers a discounted rental rate</li>
        <li>waives the requirement that the renter be at least 25</li>
        <li>provides insurance coverage against both liability and physical damage</li>
      </ol>

      To qualify, the trip must have been approved by the club and registered
      with <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/sole">Student Organizations, Leadership and Engagement</a>
      <strong>2 weeks in advance</strong>.
      Contact <a href="mailto:mitoc-bursar@mit.edu">mitoc-bursar@mit.edu</a>
      to obtain confirmation of trip registration.
    </p>

    <p>
      See the Vice President of Finance's guidelines to
      <a href="https://vpf.mit.edu/book-domestic-ground-transportation">booking ground transportation</a>
      and
      <a href="https://insurance.mit.edu/services/insurance-coverage-claims/automobile/rentals">MIT Office of Insurance's rental policy</a>
      for more details.
    </p>

    <p>
      Make sure to decline liability and collision/physical damage coverage when reserving or picking up the vehicle.
    </p>

     <p>
       Note: MIT affiliates may also receive discounts for "personal/leisure" trips
       when renting through Avis and Budget. See the links above for more details.
       MITOC cannot reimburse for "personal" travel.

    <h4>Car-sharing services</h4>
    <p>
      If using a car sharing service such as
      <a href="https://www.zipcar.com/universities/massachusetts-institute-of-technology">Zipcar</a>,
      be aware that the mileage included in the hourly/daily rate is often less
      than the round-trip distance to and from out-of-state trailheads
      frequently visited by MITOC, which may result in additional charges.
