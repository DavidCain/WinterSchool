<h2>Becoming a Winter School Leader</h2>
<div class="well" id="qualifications">
  <h4>What qualifications do I need to become a Winter School leader?</h4>
  <p>
    A Winter School rating provided by the Winter Safety Committee is required
    to lead a trip during Winter School. These ratings control what kinds of
    trips leaders are permitted to create. Each Winter School trip must have a
    minimum of two leaders, at least one of whom is rated as a "primary/full"
    leader. A first aid certification: WFA or higher is required to obtain a B
    or C primary leader rating.
  </p>
  <p>
    The qualifications for each of the three categories &mdash; hiking, ice-climbing
    and skiing &mdash; include a combination of outdoor experience and leadership
    related to that activity. It is possible to become a winter hiking leader
    with minimal winter hiking experience, as long as you are a current MITOC
    three-season hiking leader or equivalent.

  <h4>What are co-leaders?</h4>

  <p>
      People are often given co-ratings by the Winter Safety Committee. This
      rating is given to those who show promise in an area but have not
      demonstrated the specific outdoor experience/leadership/group management
      necessary for a full rating. Co-leaders require a primary leader to be
      present in the group in order to lead a trip. The co-leader position
      promotes experience building under the supervision of an experienced
      leader. Co-leaders are encouraged to use the earlier weeks of Winter
      School to demonstrate the skill set necessary to be "upgraded" to primary
      leader prior to the close of IAP.
