    <h4>Leader Requirements</h4>
    <p>
      All WS trips must have at least two leaders and one of these leaders must
      be a full leader for the terrain (and if necessary the activity).
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      <em>A coB leader needs a full B leader to co-lead a B trip.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      For A and B activity trips (climbing or skiing) one leader can be the
      full leader for the activity and the other leader can be the full leader
      for the terrain.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      <em>A B coI and a coB I leader can lead a BI trip together.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not the case for C trips.

      If you want to lead a C trip with ice climbing or skiing, the full C
      leader also needs to be the full I or S leader as the terrain itself and
      activity canâ€™t be separated effectively from a risk management
      perspective.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      <em>A C coS and coC S can NOT lead a CS trip. A CS leader is required for a CS trip.</em>
    </p>
  </div>
