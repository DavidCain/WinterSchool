    <h4>Rating Upgrades</h4>

    <p>
      Upgrades work on a reference system. If you are planning on requesting a
      recommendation for an upgrade, you should let your co-leaders know while
      planning your trip. You should try to handle as much of the organization of
      the trip as possible and be sure to lead the group at times while in the
      wilderness to demonstrate your ability!
    </p>

    <p>
      To move from coB to B or coC to C you should be leading that level trip,
      emailing the WSC to let us know you want to upgrade, and having your
      co-leaders emailing the WSC references shortly after your trip is finished.
      We typically ask for two favorable references (from two different trips)
      for an upgrade. We are looking for good group management and decision
      making, a clear understanding of MITOC rules, and the ability to organize a
      successful trip!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a coB rated leader who wants a coC rating you should
      participate as a participant on a C trip and ask your leaders for
      references. We are looking to see that you are familiar with the issues of
      above treeline travel, are able to take care of yourself, and have
      experience using traction.
