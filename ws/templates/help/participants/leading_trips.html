<h2>Leading Winter School Trips</h2>
<div class="well" id="qualifications">
  <h4>What qualifications are needed to lead a Winter School trip?</h4>
  <p>Each Winter School trip must have a minimum of two leaders, at least one of whom is rated as a 'primary' leader.
  The Winter Safety Committe gives ratings to all trip leaders. These ratings control what kinds of trips leaders are permitted to create.</p>
  <p>Qualifications for a particular category are a combination of outdoor experience and leadership, particularly in winter conditions.</p>

  <h5>First aid certifications</h5>
  <p>WFA or higher is required for all B and C primary leaders.</p>
</div>

<div class="well" id="ratings">
  <h4>How do ratings work?</h4>
  <p>All leaders are assigned a location rating along with any applicable activity ratings.</p>

  {% include 'snippets/ws_ratings.html' %}

  <p>
  Activity ratings are subordinate to location ratings: a {B, S} leader can only lead ski mountaineering trips below treeline.
  A leader rated {A, co-B, co-I} can act as primary leader on A-level trips, can co-lead B-level trips with a full B or C leader, and can co-lead ice climbing trips as long as they qualify as B level or below.

<div class="well" id="coleaders">
  <h4>Co-leaders</h4>

  <p>Co-leaders require a primary leader to be present in the group in order to lead a trip.
  Co-ratings are given to those who show promise in an area but have not demonstrated the specific outdoor experience/leadership/group management necessary for a full rating.
  This allows them to gain experience under the supervision of an experienced leader.
  Co-leaders are encouraged to use the earlier weeks of Winter School to demonstrate the skill set necessary to be 'upgraded' to primary leader prior to the close of IAP.

<div class="well" id="benefits">
  <h4>What benefits come with being a leader?</h4>
  As a trip leader, you receive free gear rentals and a course subsidy for Wilderness First Aid certification (WFA, WAFA, WFR, WEMT).
