<h2>How to be the WIMP</h2>

<div class="well" id="responsibilities">
  <h4>Responsibilities of the WIMP</h4>
  <p>
    As the "Worry if Missing Person," it is the job of the WIMP to ensure that
    all trips return safely, and to coordinate an emergency response if a trip
    is unaccounted for. During Winter School, the WIMP is a volunteer position
    filled each week by a volunteer MITOCer.

              <strong>Do not print or email participant medical information.</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Check off trips as they report back.</li>
      <li>When all of the day's trips are back safely, consider sending an email to <a href="mailto:mitoc-wsc@mit.edu">the WSC</a>.</li>

  <p>
    <ol>

      <li>Wait 30 minutes, then call the leaders again. If they don't respond, call each of the participants.</li>
      <li>Repeat every 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Also try calling someone at each of the cabins to see if the trip has returned but failed to inform the WIMP.</li>
