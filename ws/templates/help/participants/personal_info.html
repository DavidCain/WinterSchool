  <p>We will occasionally share your name, email address, and car description with other participants for trip-planning purposes.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Render first aid</li>
      <li>Notify an emergency contact</li>
      <li>Describe a missing trip's cars to search-and-rescue teams</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    We are required to share your name, email address, and cell phone number with MIT's

<div class="well" id="security">
  <h4>How secure is my information?</h4>
  <p>We use encryption across the site to ensure secure transmission of personal information. We store your information behind a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).</p>
