<h1>Lottery Pair</h1>

<p class="lead">
  Specify another participant that you'd like to go on trips with.
</p>

<p>
  {% if is_winter_school %}
    When the lottery runs, you will either both be placed on a trip, or be placed
    on your highest ranked trip's waitlist.
  {% else %}
    When a trip's lottery runs, you will either both be placed on it, or neither
    of you will.
  {% endif %}
</p>

<p>
  The other participant must confirm that they are part of this pair.
  Otherwise, no effort will be made to place you both on the same trip.
